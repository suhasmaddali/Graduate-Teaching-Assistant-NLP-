# Graduate Teaching Assistant NLP

I worked as a graduate teaching assistant at Khoury College of Computer Sciences for the course Natural Language Processing (NLP DS 6120). 

During this time, I was mostly involved in designing college wide meetings with students and ensuring that they perform well on the tests and assessments.
